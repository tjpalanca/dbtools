`{dbtools}` combines utilities to deal with reading from and writing
to  
relational databases in a unified way, especially in a data engineering
or web application context.

## Inspiration

-   [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and
    [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) - gold standard
    in the Python ecosystem for interacting with relational databases.
